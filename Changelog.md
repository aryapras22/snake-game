// Bugs

1. [X] boundaries from grid >> actual screen size
2. [ ] first food eaten didn't add snake length
    1. [ ] i found because the first food overlapped the head
3. [ ] when at certain speed and score, maploop doesnt work
4. [ ] another bug in map loop is when i travel too often so not all segment teleported

// Things that really weird and should be changed

* [ ] grid control everything. should be making it more simpler and stop redudancy
* [X] speed instance

// Alternate method

* [ ] created overloading constructor for adding previous tail to new tail instances
* [X] figure out how timer works
* [X] to making it simple i gonna focus on changing map loop to gameover

// Future Features

* [X] Score board
  * [ ] high score board
* [ ] colission between head and body
* [X] screen loop ( waiting boundaries to be fixed)
* [ ] adding level button for adding speed
